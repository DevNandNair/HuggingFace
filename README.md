# HuggingFace
 Article summerizer using huggingface


     1.The structure:
    Backend:Django
    FrontEnd:HTML and Bootstrap
    
    2.Integration of hugging Face:
    I installed the transformer library of huggingface and imported the pipeline. I used the summerizer model for the project
    and set up the views.py of my django project. The project recieves big articles as input and summerises them in less 
    than 130 words
